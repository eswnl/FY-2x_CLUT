## Introduction

The Fengyun-2 series of satellites are geostationary satellites that deliver images of earth once per hour. The delivery consists of S-VISSR data: 1 VIS, 3 IR and 1 Watervapour images. They are delivered on the L-band frequency 1687.5 MHz. If you are within the footprint of the satellite, it is possible to receive with at least a 1.2m dish and Nooelec Saw filter.
As there are both VIS and IR channels, it is possible to create false colour images by using CLUT (colour look up table).
